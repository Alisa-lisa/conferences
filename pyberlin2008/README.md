# Self-quantify

it's a not-so-young hot topic. Getting data about you to understand better how you tick and how to utilize your resources in 
order to achieve more productivity, happiness, balance, inner peace and overall health.

2. How
3. When
4. How to use the results?


This talk presents my own experience in this topic.
