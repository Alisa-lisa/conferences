1. make sure all dependecies are installed. Poetry requires `python 3.12`. Run `poetry install` and activate the env `./venv/<poetry_virtual_env>/bin/activate`
2. run `jupyter notebbok` and navigate to `localhost:8888`
3. Open `Analysis.ipynb` and execute step by step. Change data sources at your convenience. Make sure your file has 2 columns: `bpm` and `timestamp€ý,€ý,`
